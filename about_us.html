						purpose</a> of this
					application is to assist individuals who are physically disabled wheelchair users but can also be
					used any and every individual visiting the UCO campus. The app allows users to register and provides
					a guest login to people who are planning on using this app temporarily on their visit to the UCO
					campus. Even though the app is specifically created disabled wheelchair users, it can be used by
					anyone above the age of 5 regardless of their educational background or technical expertise if the
					users are familiar with the use of internet and have access to a computer or any cellular mobile
					devices. Here by users we classify three different types of individuals which include the guest
					users, the registered users, and the administrators of the app. In terms of usersâ€™ functionalities,
					the registered users will have access to managing and saving locations from the dropdown list
					whereas the guests will not have access to this added feature of this app. As for the
					administrators, they will have access to modifying the prototype depending on when the app needs to
					be updated for adding new features or fixing bugs within the existing platform.
